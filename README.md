# NIFTY-QUANT-RATIO-ANALYSIS

Overview

The NIFTY_PE.ipynb notebook performs a quantitative analysis of the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio for various stock indices. This project is designed to explore and visualize the P/B ratios to assess valuation trends and compare current values to historical averages.
